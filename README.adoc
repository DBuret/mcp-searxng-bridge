|An implementation of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that allows AI agents to perform web searches and extract web content. Built with Rust for speed and reliability.

Unlike standard MCP servers using `stdio`, this bridge operates over **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** with a **Hybrid Response** mode, making it compatible with cloud deployments and local clients like LM Studio.
|===

toc::[]

NOTE: This project is a **gateway only** and does **not** include https://docs.searxng.org/[SearXNG]. You must deploy and configure your own https://docs.searxng.org/[SearXNG] instance separately.

== Features

* **Dual Tools**: 
** `search`: High-speed web search via SearXNG.
** `fetch_page`: Smart content extraction (HTML to Markdown) with boilerplate removal.
* **Network-Ready**: Connect via SSE/HTTP; no local child-process management required.
* **LM Studio Optimized**: Specialized "Hybrid Handshake" to prevent connection timeouts.
* **Modern Rust**: Leveraging Edition 2024 and the Axum/Tokio ecosystem.
* **Docker Optimized**: Multi-stage builds for a tiny footprint (~35MB).

== Tools

The bridge exposes two primary tools to the AI:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Tool | Description

| `search`
| Performs a query on SearXNG and returns titles, snippets, and URLs.

| `fetch_page`
| Downloads a specific URL, extracts the main content (article/body), and converts it to clean Markdown.
|===

== Deployment Options

=== 1. Using the DockerHub Image (Fastest)
[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-searxng-bridge \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_SX_URL="http://your-searxng-ip:18080" \
  davidburet/mcp-searxng-bridge:0.3.0
----

=== 2. Building with Docker (Local)
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t mcp-searxng-bridge .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e MCP_SX_URL="http://172.17.0.1:18080" mcp-searxng-bridge
----

=== 3. Native Binary Build
Requires Rust 1.85+ (Edition 2024).
[source,bash]
----
cargo build --release
export MCP_SX_URL="http://localhost:18080"
./target/release/mcp-searxng-rs
----

== Configuration

Environment variables (prefixed with `MCP_SX_`):

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Variable | Description | Default

| `MCP_SX_URL`
| URL of your SearXNG instance
| `http://172.17.0.1:18080`

| `MCP_SX_PORT`
| Port the bridge will listen on
| `3000`

| `MCP_SX_LOG`
| Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
| `info`
|===

== Connecting to LM Studio 

Tested with https://lmstudio.ai[LMStudio] version 0.4.2+.

To integrate the bridge, edit your `mcp.json` configuration file:

* **Location**:
** Windows: `%APPDATA%\LM Studio\mcp.json`
** macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/LM Studio/mcp.json`
** Linux: `~/.config/lmstudio/mcp.json`

* **Configuration**:
[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng-suite": {
      "url": "http://YOUR_BRIDGE_IP:3000/sse"
    }
  }
}
----

TIP: This bridge uses a **Hybrid Initialize** response. It returns the handshake directly via HTTP POST to avoid the 60s timeout often encountered with LM Studio's SSE implementation._

== Known Limitations

* **Broadcast Channel**: Currently, responses are broadcasted to all active SSE subscribers. Ideal for private/single-user use.
* **Security**: No built-in Auth. Keep it behind a VPN or trusted network.
* **Scraping**: `fetch_page` does not execute JavaScript (uses a static HTML scraper).
