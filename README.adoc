An implementation of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that allows AI agents to perform web searches using a **SearXNG** instance. Built with Rust for speed and reliability.

Unlike standard MCP servers using `stdio`, this bridge operates over **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**, enabling remote deployments on NAS, Docker, or specialized servers.

NOTE: This project is a **gateway only** and does **not** include https://docs.searxng.org/[SearXNG]. You must deploy and configure your own https://docs.searxng.org/[SearXNG] instance separately.

== Features

* **Network-Ready**: Connect via SSE/HTTP; no local child-process management required.
* **Modern Rust**: Leveraging Edition 2024 features and the Axum/Tokio ecosystem.
* **Docker Optimized**: Multi-stage builds for a tiny footprint (~30MB).
* **Transparent**: Syslog-compliant logs with backend performance tracking.

== Deployment Options

=== 1. Using the DockerHub Image (Fastest)
The easiest way to run the bridge is using the official pre-built image.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-searxng-bridge \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_SX_URL="http://your-searxng-ip:18080" \
  davidburet/mcp-searxng-bridge:0.2.0
----

=== 2. Building with Docker (Local)
If you want to build your own container from source:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the image
docker build -t mcp-searxng-bridge .

# Run the local container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e MCP_SX_URL="http://172.17.0.1:18080" mcp-searxng-bridge
----

=== 3. Native Binary Build
Requires Rust 1.85+ (for Edition 2024 support).

[source,bash]
----
cargo build --release
export MCP_SX_URL="http://localhost:18080"
./target/release/mcp-searxng-rs
----

== Configuration

Environment variables (prefixed with `MCP_SX_`):

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Variable | Description | Default

| `MCP_SX_URL`
| URL of your SearXNG instance
| `http://172.17.0.1:18080`

| `MCP_SX_PORT`
| Port the bridge will listen on
| `3000`

| `MCP_SX_LOG`
| Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`)
| `info`
|===

== Connecting to LM Studio

To integrate the bridge with LM Studio, you need to manually edit the `mcp.json` configuration file:

* Locate the `mcp.json` file
**  Navigate to LM Studio's configuration directory:
*** Windows: `%APPDATA%\LM Studio\mcp.json` (working fine with mistralai_ministral-3-14b-reasoning-2512)
*** macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/LM Studio/mcp.json` (not tested)
*** Linux: `~/.config/lmstudio/mcp.json` (not tested)
* Edit the `mcp.json` file:
** Open the file in a text editor.
** Add the following entry to the `"servers"` array:
[source,json]
----
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searxng-search": {
      "url": "http://mcp-searxng-bridge:3000/sse"
    }
  }
}
----

Replace `http://mcp-searxng-bridge:3000/sse` with the actual URL of your mcp-searxng-bridge instance.

== Known Limitations

* **Broadcast Channel**: Uses a global broadcast channel; every connected SSE client currently receives all search results (best for single-user local setups).
* **Security**: No built-in authentication. Use within a trusted network or behind a VPN/Reverse Proxy.
* **Protocol**: Currently supports `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
